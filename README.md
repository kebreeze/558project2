# National Parks Service API

This function allows user to access the `campgrounds` endpoint on the
National Parks Service API. They can specify two arguments, one for
`stateAbbreviation` and a second for `limitResultsTo`. If no information
is entered for these, the default values are “NC” and “100”.

``` r
getCampgrounds<- function(stateAbbreviation="NC", limitResultsTo="100"){
  baseURL<-"https://developer.nps.gov/api/v1/campgrounds?"
  
  state<- paste("stateCode=", stateAbbreviation=stateAbbreviation, sep = "")
  
  limit<- paste("limit=", limitResultsTo=limitResultsTo, sep = "")
  
  searchURL<- paste(baseURL,state,"&", limit, "&", apiKey, sep = "")
  
  campgrounds<- fromJSON(searchURL)
  return(campgrounds$data)

}
```

Test `getCampgrounds()` function using default settings

``` r
defaultCampResults<- getCampgrounds()

defaultCampResults
```

    ## 4  Over 2 million visitors annually come to enjoy the scenic beauty of Cades Cove and its many historic structures. Popular activities here include hiking, biking, touring the 11-mile Cades Cove Loop Road and observing wildlife. Whether blanketed in bright wildflowers in the spring or vivid colors in the fall, the scenery at Cades Cove never disappoints. Cades Cove is a broad, verdant valley surrounded by mountains and is one of the most popular destinations within Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

The secluded setting offers visitors the ability to enjoy a multitude of recreational activities like hiking and fishing, without the crowds, which are sometimes common in other parts of the park. Cataloochee Campground is surrounded by picturesque mountain ranges and pristine mountain streams, like nearby Cataloochee Creek. Elk are common in this part of the park, during the spring and fall. At a 2,600 foot elevation, Cataloochee provides a moderate climate, characterized by mild winters and hot, humid summers. Whether blanketed in bright spring wildflowers or exploding with vivid fall colors, the scenery at Cataloochee never disappoints. Cataloochee offers a traditional outdoor camping experience with the added convenience of flush toilets and drinking water. There are no hookups or showers at the campground. Hiking trails and fishing streams are easily accessible from the site and the nearby Cataloochee Group Campground can accommodate larger parties of guests. Additionally, the Cataloochee Horse Campground provides convenient camping for horseback riding enthusiasts. Hammocks are allowed in the campground with the following guidelines: Must be over the footprint of the campsite, limited to trees 10 inches in diameter with adequate padding around the tree and only 2 hammocks are allowed to be suspended from the same tree.

Whether blanketed in bright wildflowers in the spring or vivid colors in the fall, the scenery at Deep Creek never disappoints. The camp offers 92 individual sites, all with grills, tables and campfire rings, perfect for a meal or a late-night s'mores session. Hookups and showers are not provided, but flush toilets and drinking water are available. Deep Creek is in the southeastern portion of the park and provides a moderate climate, typified by mild winters and hot, humid summers. Because of its proximity to water, Deep Creek is an ideal campground for water recreation and books up quickly during summer months. Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a hiker's paradise, with plenty of trails easily accessible from the Deep Creek campsites. An easy 1.6 mile roundtrip hike will allow you to enjoy two beautiful waterfalls in the Deep Creek area. Walk Deep Creek Trail 0.7 mile to the junction with Indian Creek Trail. On your way you can view elegant Tom Branch Falls located on the far side of Deep Creek. Turn right at the junction with Indian Creek Trail and proceed approximately 200' to Indian Creek Falls.

This area is minimally developed without paved roads, hard surfaced parking areas, or street lighting. Without bright lights, the night sky is dark enough for not only some excellent stargazing but also viewing of the Milky Way. The ocean is nearby for surf fishing, swimming, and shelling.

Check-out time is noon. No more than two vehicles (pop-up camper is considered a vehicle) and six persons may occupy a single site. Parking space for extra vehicles is severely limited, so plan accordingly. If you must bring more than two vehicles, make arrangements to park your extra vehicle outside the park or purchase an additional campsite. From Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend, camping is limited to a total of 14 days within a 30-day period. The campgrounds are located on the ocean side separated from the beach by barrier dunes. Soil at all the campgrounds is sandy; therefore, longer than normal tent stakes are recommended. There are no shade trees. Mosquitoes may be a problem, so netting and insect repellent are recommended.

Check-out time is noon. No more than two vehicles (pop-up camper is considered a vehicle) and six persons may occupy a single site. Parking space for extra vehicles is severely limited, so plan accordingly. If you must bring more than two vehicles, make arrangements to park your extra vehicle outside the park or purchase an additional campsite. From Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend, camping is limited to a total of 14 days within a 30-day period. Soil at all the campgrounds is sandy; therefore, longer than normal tent stakes are recommended. There are no shade trees. Mosquitoes may be a problem, so netting and insect repellent are recommended.

All pets must be kept leashed when outside of the cabin and when on the beach. * Driving may only take place on the open beach, or on established, marked sand trails within the camp or behind the dunes. * All drivers must be at least 16 years old and hold a valid driver’s license, including for ATVs and UTVs. What isn't allowed: * Vehicles, including ATVs and UTVs, may not drive on the dunes. * Fireworks, including sparklers, may not be used within the camp or on the beach. * Drones may not be used within the camp or on the beach. * Metal detectors may not be used within the camp or on the beach.

    ## 15                          Bring a solar cell phone charger with you as there is no place to plug in a charger unless you are using a generator in the cabin. Cell phone signal strength varies according to provider. There are small “dead zones” up and down the beach, generally these areas are not very large and by moving a short distance can generally pick up the signal again.

    ## 9  Invasive insects and diseases that live in firewood are a growing threat to forests along the Blue Ridge Parkway and the surrounding region. Tree-killing insects and diseases can hitch-hike hundreds of miles on firewood when people bring wood into campgrounds. Counties in many states have federal or state quarantines in place which prohibit moving firewood. These quarantines were issued to prevent the spread of emerald ash borer, Asian long-horn beetle, gypsy moth, and thousand cankers disease. Federal and state regulations prohibit visitors from bringing firewood to the park from these counties. See https://www.nps.gov/blri/planyourvisit/firewood-quarantine-by-state.htm for a list of quarantined counties.

Open campfires must be built on the ocean beach below the high tide line (in damp sand), fires may not be larger than 3 feet in diameter. All fires must be extinguished with water until they are “cold and out”, in other words the coals should be cold to the touch before they can be considered “out”. Remember that you are the fire department when you are there, practice good fire safety.

If your group has more vehicles, ask at the cabin office for where you may park them. Vehicles should follow the Beach Driving best practices (https://www.nps.gov/calo/planyourvisit/orv.htm) – lower your tire pressure and have the equipment to dig your way out if you become stuck. If bringing a vehicle with you on your trip, be sure to purchase your driving permit before coming (https://www.nps.gov/calo/planyourvisit/orv_ed_certificate.htm)

Sites are located on a paved lot surrounded by oak and pine trees. Tent camping is not allowed, and all camping vehicles must be self-contained with a toilet and wastewater receptacle, as there are no restrooms on site. A dirt path begins at the campground and switchbacks down to a bridge over Brandy Creek before meeting up with a paved trail that winds through the Brandy Creek picnic area to a swim beach. Restrooms, showers and a small store are located at Brandy Creek beach. Kayaks and paddleboards may be rented at the beach in the summer.

    ## 13 Camp 4 is open all year. During summer, reservations are required. In spring and fall, a ranger may be onsite to register campers. In winter, campers self register. From May 20 through September 7, 2022, campsites are available only by daily lottery, one day in advance, via recreation.gov. The lottery is open from midnight to 4 pm Pacific time each day, with results emailed shortly after 4 pm. Applicants can apply for up to seven nights. There is a non-refundable lottery fee of $10 per application (up to 6 people). The camping fee (only charged with a successful lottery application) is $10 per person per night. From September 8 through 30 arrivals, all reservations will be released at 7 am PDT on September 7. Each person (not just the primary applicant) must check in at the campground using a valid photo ID that matches the entry on the lottery application. (Minors must check in but do not need a photo ID.) Up to six people will be assigned to each campsite.
